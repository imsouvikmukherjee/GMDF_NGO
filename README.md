I developed a GMDF NGO + Multiple School Management System web application with four user roles: super admin, school admin, teacher, and student. The NGO section includes static content, blogs, crowdfunding posts, and membership options, enabling NGOs to share information and collect funds. The school section provides a comprehensive solution for managing school operations, including student profiles, schedules, ID card generation, fee collection, and a notes section where students can access notes and lecture videos. This system streamlines administrative tasks and enhances the learning experience, making it a versatile tool for both NGO and school management.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
